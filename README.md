**CASH COW:** Cash Cow is an addictive idle clicker game that simulates personal finance decisions, stock trading, and more! There are different budgeting and stock-trading apps out there, but Cash Cow is unique in the sense that it helps young adults learn about money management in a fun and risk-free environment since these skills arenâ€™t taught in school.
