# $cammer$ Project
**CASH COW:** Cash Cow is an addictive idle clicker game that simulates personal finance decisions, stock trading, and more! There are different budgeting and stock-trading apps out there, but Cash Cow is unique in the sense that it helps young adults learn about money management in a fun and risk-free environment since these skills arenâ€™t taught in school.

## Build Instructions
- Clone the repository
- If there is a Podfile.lock in ecs189e-scammers/CashCow, delete that file
- In the terminal, run `pod install` in the ecs189e-scammers/CashCow directory
- Open the CashCow.xcworkspace file in Xcode
- Run the application, and voila!
